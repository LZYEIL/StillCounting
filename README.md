# Boring Website Series: StillCounting

<br>

> *A website that does nothing but keeps counting. Forever...*

<br>

## Introduction

**[StillCounting](https://still-counting.vercel.app/)** was built by **HTML5/TailwindCSS/Vanilla JavaScript** and is part of my *Boring Website Series*: A collection of minimalistic websites that exist for no reason.

This one just tells you: 
- How long this site has been online.
- How long you’ve wasted staring at this page.

That’s it.

## Why? 
*[StillCounting](https://still-counting.vercel.app/)* is a quiet reminder of the relentless passage of time.

It invites you to pause and reflect on how much of our lives we spend waiting, watching clocks, or doing nothing at all.

You may feel amused, or perhaps uneasy. But either way, the page keeps counting.

Because time doesn’t stop. And neither does *StillCounting*.
