# Boring Website Series: StillCounting

<br>

> *A website that does nothing but keeps counting. Forever...*

<br>

## Introduction

**StillCounting** is part of my *Boring Website Series*: A collection of minimalistic websites that exist for no reason.

This one just tells you: 
- How long this site has been online.
- How long you’ve wasted staring at this page.

That’s it.

## Why? 
*StillCounting* exists to remind you of time… and how much of it you’re wasting.  
It doesn’t judge you, but it does keep track.

## Part of the *Boring Website Series*
